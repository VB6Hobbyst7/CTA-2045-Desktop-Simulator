# CTA-2045 Desktop Simulator version 19.08.22

The ANSI/CTA-2045-A simulator software acts as a smart grid device (SGD) or universal communications module (UCM) for the purposes of testing and evaluating devices that are compliant with the ANSI/CTA-2045-A standard.

## Description
This application provides a fully functional simulator for both SGDs and UCMs. Through the use of different cable sets, both AC and DC form factors are supported. This manual describes how to use this software to emulate both device types and all three message categories of data link, basic demand response (DR) messages, and intermediate DR messages.

## Benefits and Value
This application has a number of uses to benefit utilities, manufacturers, and vendors.
- Simulate an SGD – In this mode, the application can be used to test UCMs to evaluate their compliance with the ANSI/CTA-2045-A standard.
- Simulate a UCM – In this mode, the application can be used to test SGDs to evaluate their compliance with the ANSI/CTA-2045-A standard.
- Simulate both SGD and UCM – In this mode, the application can act as a tutor for developers who are unfamiliar with the ANSI/CTA-2045-A standard in understanding how to implement the standard by viewing example exchanges and performing “what if” testing.
- Act as an automated test system – Using the test script mode, repetitive testing can be simplified and allow product testing with minimal human involvement.

This simulator application may assist in reducing the cost of product evaluations, development, and testing.

## Platform Requirements
This software has been tested on Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 7, both 32- and 64-bit. It should also operate on all current Microsoft platforms such as Windows Vista, and Windows 8.
