These zip files contain files needed for manufacturing printed circuit boards.  It also contains pdf files of the schematic and board, for reference.  The manufacturing files are in standard RS-274-X Gerber file format, which is a very widely used universal format for manufacturing PCB's. Most PCB manufacturers have an email link on their website for sending in files to get a price quote.  Just email the entire zip folder, and tell them how many boards you want, and they will send you back a quote, and you can go from there.  The zip folder also contains a file called "PickandPlace", and a file called "Bom", which are CSV files.  The PickandPlace file contains a list of the x and y coordinates of the components, so a manufacturer can use a machine to place the parts on the board.  The file “Bom” is a bill of materials - and it lists the components their part numbers.  Many PCB manufacturers are also capable of 'stuffing' boards, so sending the entire zip file will allow them to see the whole job and send back a quote.

Please note that the PCB called UCM plug contains a board edge connector.  This connector from TE connectivity is mounted on the edge of the board, so that the board edge fits into a slot on the connector, and connector pins are then soldered to pads on one side of the board, right near the edge.  The proper board thickness for this connector is .039 inches.  The PCB manufacturing industry considers a standard thickness board to be .062 inches thick. If you don't specify in your email that you want a .039" thick board for the UCM plug, the connector will not fit.  The SGD shield board should be a standard .062 inch board.
